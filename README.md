# Student AutoMessenger

## Project Overview
This program was initially designed for piano teachers looking to automate their sms texting to students for class reminder.
Teachers are able to input student/parent info, such as phone number, class date and class time.
Of the day of the student's class, a message will be sent to the associated number reminding the student of their class 
time.
